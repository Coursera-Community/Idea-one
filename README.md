Coursera Mentors Community 

It would be great if all the Coursera Mentors added in this organization can post a link to this organization in the discussion forums of courses they are Mentoring in Coursera so that Mentor along with the learners can leverage the knowledge acquired in the course to build something awesome.

And all the learners who are enrolled in Coursera Courses are advised to do the same by informing their Mentors to collaborate with them to build something cool in this organization itself.

And all the other members of the organization who are neither Mentors, learners can help in resolving issues raised by learners & Mentors while building an application that they are following in the course they are enrolled in and other members can even help in reviewing pull requests.

Other Members can pitch thier own idea to make Coursera a better place to learn an to extend education via Coursera by leveraging Coursera open-source community build by Coursera Mentors.

One of the advantages is that we can also prevent plagiarism because I have encountered certain things while reviewing learners assignment if learners along with Mentors build something here in the organization itself then learners can also be evaluated whether they have learnt something or not becuase they all will be contributing by sending pull requests and contribution of every learner will be reflected in the project that they are building along with their mentors eventually preventing learners from cheating.

We are also in a phase of building slack,gitter channel in order to improve communication among members of this organization anyways feel free to open issues in this repo. if anyone is facing difficulty in understanding anything.
